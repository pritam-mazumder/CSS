    DOM: Document Object Model

    DOM is a platform and language-neutral interface,
    that allows programs and scripts 
    to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document.

    When a page is loaded, 
    the browser creates a DOM of the page 
    which is constructed as a tree of objects.
   
        
    HTML id and class attributes

    When an html element is given as id, it serves as a unique identifier for that element.
    On the other hand, when an html element is given a class,
    it now belong to that class.
    More then one elements can belong to a single class but every element must have a unique id (if addigned).

    OR

    One element (<>) can have more then one class (class="") and
    One class (class="") can be present on more then one element  (<>)

    eg.
    <div id="id1" class="c2 c3 c4">
        abc
    </div>

    There are 3 ways to add CSS to HTML:

        1. <style> tag  ==> Adding <style>...</style> to html <head>
        2. Inline CSS   ==> Adding Css using style attribute
        3. External CSS ==> Adding a stylesheet (.css) file to HTML using <link> tag
