<!-- 
    DOM: Document Object Model

    When a page is loaded, 
    the browser creates a DOM of the page 
    which is constructed as a tree of objects.

    The HTML DOM allows JavaScript to change the style of HTML elements.

    The HTML DOM allows you to execute code when an event occurs.

    Events are generated by the browser when "things happen" to HTML elements:

        1. An element is clicked on
        2. The page has loaded
        3. Input fields are changed

    
        
    HTML id and class attributes

    When an html element is given as id, it serves as a unique identifier for that element.
    On the other hand, when an html element is given a class,
    it now belong to that class.
    More then one elements can belong to a single class but every element must have a unique id (if addigned).

    OR

    One element (<>) can have more then one class (class="") and
    One class (class="") can be present on more then one element  (<>)

    eg.
    <div id="id1" class="c2 c3 c4">
        abc
    </div>

    There are 3 ways to add CSS to HTML:

        1. <style> tag  ==> Adding <style>...</style> to html <head>
        2. Inline CSS   ==> Adding Css using style attribute
        3. External CSS ==> Adding a stylesheet (.css) file to HTML using <link> tag
