    CSS Backgrounds

    The CSS background properties are used to add background effects for elements.


    1. CSS background-color:

        The background-color property specifies the background color of an element.
            background-color: lightblue;

    2. CSS background-image:

        The background-image property specifies an image to use as the background of an element.
        By default, the image is repeated so it covers the entire element.
            background-image: url("paper.gif");

    3. CSS background-repeat:

        By default, the background-image property repeats an image both horizontally and vertically.
            Property Values:
             - background-repeat: repeat;       => repeated both vertically and horizontally.
             - background-repeat: repeat-x;     => repeated only horizontally
             - background-repeat: repeat-y;     => repeated only vertically
             - background-repeat: no-repeat     => image will only be shown once and does not repeated
             - background-repeat: space;        => image will repeate as much as possible without clipping. The first and last image is pinned to either side of the element, and whitespace is distributed evenly between the images
             - background-repeat: round;        => repeate and squish or stretch to fill the space (no gaps)

    4. CSS background-size:

        It specifies the size of the background images. The image can be left to its natural size, stretched, or constrained to fit the available space.
            Property Values:
            background-size: cover;             => fits & no empty spaces
            background-size: contain;           => fits & omage is fully visible
            background-size: auto;              => display in original size

    5. CSS background-position:

        The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image.
            Property Values:
             - background-position: top/bottom/left/right/center;
             - background-position: x% y%
    
    6. CSS background-attachment:

        The background-attachment property sets whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page, or is fixed.
             - background-attachment: scroll;   =>  image will scroll. This is default
             - background-attachment: fixed;    =>  image will not scroll.
             - background-attachment: local;    =>  image will scroll with the element's contents

    5. CSS background-shorthand:
    
        The background shorthand property is a way to specify the values of multiple CSS background properties in a single declaration.
